// How I will solve the exercise:
// I will make a variable to house the string with the message of the secret code
const notification = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination";

// Then, I'll add variables containing the equations where, if solved, reveals the answer to the combination
const comb1 = "20 / 2";
const comb2 = "10 * 4";
const comb3 = "49 - 10";

// Finally, I'll write an alert to make a popup say the strings
alert(notification+" \nCombination 1: "+comb1+"\nCombination 2: "+comb2+"\nCombination 3: "+comb3);
